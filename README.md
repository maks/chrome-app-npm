# NPM in a Chrome App

using creationix's awesome commonjs style, cached file module loader.

## Just a basic prototype for now - come back later for more

## Known Issues:

* the tar parser (or gzip lib) I'm using seems to be a flakey
* need to switch to using chrisdickinsons awesome inflate js module
